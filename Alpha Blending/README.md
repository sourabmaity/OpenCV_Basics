# Alpha Blending
Alpha blending is the process of overlaying a foreground image with transparency over a background image. The transparency is often the fourth channel of an image ( e.g. in a transparent PNG), but it can also be a separate image. This transparency mask is often called the alpha mask or the alpha matte.

### AND
A bitwise AND is a binary operation that takes two equal-length binary representations and performs the logical AND operation on each pair of the corresponding bits. Thus, if both bits in the compared position are 1, the bit in the resulting binary representation is 1 (1 × 1 = 1); otherwise, the result is 0 (1 × 0 = 0 and 0 × 0 = 0).

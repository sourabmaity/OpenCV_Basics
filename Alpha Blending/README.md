# Alpha Blending
Alpha blending is the process of overlaying a foreground image with transparency over a background image. The transparency is often the fourth channel of an image ( e.g. in a transparent PNG), but it can also be a separate image. This transparency mask is often called the alpha mask or the alpha matte.
